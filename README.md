# The Red Queens Hypothesis: 
## *Does Selection Pressure Affect Co-evolution in a Predator-Prey Model?*
This project investigates whether the strength of selection pressure exerted by the predator on the prey in a predator-prey relationship affects their co-evolution behaviour. More information is found in the [report](https://github.com/vin-nag/multiagent-particle-envs/blob/master/report.pdf)

Note that the majority of this code is forked from: https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs with modifications made to suit the project

## Replicating Results:


- To run the experiments, run:
`project_NEAT.py`

- Known dependencies: Python (3.5.4), OpenAI gym (0.10.5), numpy (1.14.5) neat-python (0.92)
